# Peanote AI 📝✨

Peanote AI is a simple and smart note-taking app built using **Flutter**, **Firebase**, and **BLoC**.

You can write and save notes like any regular notepad — but here’s the cool part: it can **summarize your notes using AI**. So if you’re jotting down a long piece of info, you can get a short version of it instantly.

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- Flutter (frontend)
- Firebase (Auth + Firestore for storage)
- BLoC (for state management)
- AI API (for summarizing notes)

### ✅ Features
- Create, update, and delete notes
- Login/signup with Firebase Auth
- Cloud sync with Firestore
- Get summaries of your notes using AI

### 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `flutter pub get`  
3. Connect your Firebase project  
4. Run the app using `flutter run`

That’s it! You’re good to go.  
You can now write notes and see them summarized in seconds.
